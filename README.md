## About
I love about customizing my Linux. Changing the colors, make some widgets, etcetera. 
That was a simple thing to do, but it fun. So I think GitHub is the best place to organize my dotfiles. 

## Disclaimer
* Basically, I maintain this repo as my personal dotfiles, so it may break your setup if you don't know the basic of *nix system.
* Don't forget to cherry-pick just what you want to keep your system clean, because currently I am not using any autoinstaller-things.
* My setups are heavily depended on this script : `.bin/xrgc`. It basically used for reading colors from xrdb (.Xresource), so don't forget to pick that too.
* Last but not least, Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. Stay awesome.
 
## Overview
Currently, I am using gnome-shell as my main desktop environtment, but sometimes I am using [windowchef](https://github.com/tudurom/windowchef) and [openbox (patched)](https://github.com/dylanaraps/openbox-patched) as well.
And this is the rest of apps that I use:
- App Launcher: `rofi`
- Music Player: `mpd` and `ncmpcpp`, sometimes `audacious`
- Shell: `zsh`
- Terminal Emulator: `rxvt-unicode`
- Text Editor: `sublime-text-3`
- Web Browser: `firefox`
- Widgets: `conky`
