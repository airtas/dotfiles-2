# Dotfiles
This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my workspaces :)


## Disclaimer
* Cherry-pick just what you want to keep your system clean.
  There's no stow, no ansible, or any auto-kind-of-things here, sorry :(
* After pywal, my setup is also depended on this script : `.bin/xrgc`.
  It basically used for reading colors from xrdb (.Xresource).
