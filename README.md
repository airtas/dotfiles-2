## About
I love of customizing my linux os, changing the colors, make some widgets, etcetera. 
That was a simple thing to do, but it fun. So I think GitHub is the best place to organize my dotfiles. 

## Disclaimer
* Basically, I maintain this repo as my personal dotfiles, so it may break your setup if you don't know the basic of *nix system.
* Don't forget to cherry-pick just what you want to keep your system clean, because currently I am not using any autoinstaller-things.
 
 Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. Stay awesome.
 
## Overview
Currently, I am using gnome-shell as my main desktop environtment, but sometimes I am using [windowchef](https://github.com/tudurom/windowchef) as well.
And this is the rest of apps that I use:
- App Launcher: `rofi`
- Music Player: `mpd` and `ncmpcpp`, sometimes `audacious`
- Shell: `bash`
- Terminal Emulator: `rxvt-unicode`
- Text Editor: `sublime-text-3`
- Web Browser: `firefox`
- Widgets: `conky`

## Setups
* `windowchef` [noir-thin preset with conky-mpd-dark.rc](https://github.com/yuune/dotfiles/raw/master/previews/noir-thin.png) 

* `windowchef` [noir preset with conky-mpd.rc](https://github.com/yuune/dotfiles/raw/master/previews/noir.png)

* `gnome-shell` [custom ant themes (~/.themes/Ant-yuune)](https://github.com/yuune/dotfiles/raw/master/.themes/Ant-yuune/preview.png)
