#### Disclaimer

- Just cherry-pick what you want to keep your system clean. You can install the whole things but I do not recommend it.

- After pywal, my setup is also depends on this script : `.local/bin/xrgc`.
  It basically used for reading colors from xrdb (`.Xresource`). so be careful when pick something, maybe you need that script on your `$PATH`
